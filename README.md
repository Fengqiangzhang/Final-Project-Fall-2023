# Final-Project-Fall-2023
Final project for IEOR E4501 Tools for Analytics, Fall 2023

- Description: the apartment lease is ending at the end of the year, so to find a new apartment in a neighborhood which is quiet and with a lot of greenery, we want to use NYC Open Data datasets and Zillowâ€™s historic monthly rent averages to download, clean, and store data, as well as defining a set of SQL queries and visualizations to help answer questions in search of a great area to live within our budget
